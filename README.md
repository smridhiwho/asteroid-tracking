# Asteroid-tracking

##Dataset 
The current data is extracted from the table file available at : https://shorturl.at/antyG

This table lists predicted close approaches to Earth by Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs). To be classified as a PHA, an asteroid must physically approach within 0.2AU of Earth and have an absolute magnitude brighter than 22.0.                          
                                                                              
This table further was downloaded from the JPL Near Earth Object (NEO) Program              
Website, from this URL:

Minor cosmetic changes were made to remove a flag character from an otherwise numeric field and to add changes to integer values to scientific notation in another area. A PDS label was then written using the descriptive material at the bottom of the original web page.
